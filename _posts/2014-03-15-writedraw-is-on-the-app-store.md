So I began working on this app called _WriteDraw_ at the end of January based on inspiration from my wife and my friends. I have been developing iOS apps almost a year now, so I wasn&#8217;t sure I could do everything I wanted to for the app. But I stopped thinking like that and ended up accomplishing everything I wanted&#8230;for version 1.0. I submitted my app after a month of development, spending many nights getting everything working. It took apple about 8 days to approve my app and only an hour once they actually started reviewing it.

This has been a little dream of mine, I just wasn&#8217;t sure I could actually bring an iOS app to completion. I did though, and now I want to improve it and make more apps. You can download it from the Apple App Store here:Â <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/writedrawgame/id830252077?mt=8>

So if you happen to be reading this post, please download the app and to go one step further, please **rate** the app. It can give me a lot of credibility against the many apps on the App Store. I ended up naming the app WriteDrawGame to have a unique name so hopefully that isn&#8217;t confusing. Anyway, be sure to download the app and play with your friends the next time you hang out. Also, be looking out for more features and updates in the future.
