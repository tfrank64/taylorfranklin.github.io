Have you ever been stuck on a memory issue in your iOS app for days? To be honest, I have, but I learned a lot from it. In fact, I wrote a pretty detailed article about avoiding that on the IBM <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/" target="_blank">Developer Works website</a>. Unfortunately, you can still run into memory issues with Swift and ARC, but they don&#8217;t have to kill your productivity. The <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/mo-ios-memory/" target="_blank">article</a> was published a few days ago so I encourage you to check it out. The article is titled _7 Foolproof Tips for iOS memory management in Swift and Objective-C_ and includes a tutorial on using Xcode 6 Instruments.

You can check out my IBM Developer Works article here: <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/mo-ios-memory/" target="_blank">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/mo-ios-memory/</a>

Thanks for reading!
