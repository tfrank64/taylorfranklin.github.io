Recently I was inspired to submit my 2 cents to <a href="http://nshipster.com/" target="_blank">NSHipster</a> for Swift tips that helped me in 2015. I decided to submit something simple, but useful about the `where` clause in Swift 2. So I submitted my post on <a href="https://gist.github.com/natecook1000/151d8de423eb77fc87bf" target="_blank">this gist</a> a few weeks ago and wouldn&#8217;t you know, I made it in the official <a href="http://nshipster.com/new-years-2016/" target="_blank">New Years 2016 NSHipster post</a>. I started reading NSHipster back in 2013 when I started iOS development so it is an honor to be mentioned in their blog. I look forward toÂ the next opportunity to contribute to the iOS community!
